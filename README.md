## Problem 1: Daily Steps Tracker
### Description
This program allows users to input the number of steps they take each day over a month and provides the following insights:
1. The highest and lowest step counts.
2. The average daily step count.
3. The list of step counts sorted in descending order.

### Features
- Accepts daily step counts as space-separated input.
- Identifies the day with the highest and lowest steps.
- Calculates the average daily steps.
- Sorts the step counts in descending order for analysis.

### How to Run
1. Run the program in a Python environment.
2. Enter the daily step counts as space-separated values when prompted.
3. The program will display the calculated results.

## Problem 2: Library Book Borrowing Analysis
### Description
This program analyzes borrowing records from a library for a month. Users input records in the format `"Book Title - Days Borrowed"`, and the program provides the following:
1. The most borrowed and least borrowed books.
2. The average number of days books were borrowed.
3. A list of unique book titles borrowed.
4. The books sorted by borrowing duration in descending order.

### Features
- Parses user input to process borrowing records.
- Handles multiple records for the same book by summing the borrowing days.
- Identifies the book borrowed for the maximum and minimum number of days.
- Sorts the books based on borrowing duration.

### How to Run
1. Run the program in a Python environment.
2. Enter book borrowing records one by one in the format `"Book Title - Days Borrowed"`.
3. Press **Enter** on an empty line to finish input.
4. The program will display the calculated results.

# Word Scramble Game
This is a Python-based word scramble game where players try to guess the original word from a randomly scrambled version. The game uses a **visited array** technique to ensure a unique, randomized scramble for each word.

## Features

1. **Word Scrambling**:
   - Characters are shuffled into random positions using a visited array.
   - Ensures each character is used exactly once.
2. **Interactive Gameplay**:
   - Players have 5 attempts to guess the correct word.
   - Provides feedback after each incorrect guess, including the number of attempts remaining.
3. **Robust Input Handling**:
   - Handles empty inputs gracefully by prompting the user to enter a valid guess.
   - Case-insensitive input comparison.
4. **Random Word Selection**:
   - Words are selected randomly from a predefined list.
